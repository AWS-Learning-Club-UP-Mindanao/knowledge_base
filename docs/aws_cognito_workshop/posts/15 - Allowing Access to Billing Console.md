# **Allow Access to Billing Console for an IAM user**

By default, IAM users do not have access to the AWS Billing Console. To enable such access, the root user must first make a specific configuration change. This restriction is in place to enhance security and ensure that only trusted accounts can manage billing and account-related settings. Therefore, the root user must manually grant access by modifying the relevant IAM policies or settings.

## **Allow Access to the Billing Console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your root account.
2. In the navigation bar, click on your account name, and then choose **Account**.
