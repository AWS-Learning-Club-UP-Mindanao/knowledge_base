# **Permission Control Using IAM Groups**

## Creating IAM user groups

Creating and managing **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** user groups in AWS is essential for maintaining a secure and organized environment. User groups allow you to efficiently manage permissions for multiple users by assigning policies to a group rather than individually configuring each user's access.

In this guide, you'll learn how to create an IAM user group, attach policies to the group, and add users to it. This process ensures that users within a group inherit the same set of permissions, making it easier to manage access control across your AWS environment.

## Steps Overview

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console
2. Go to the IAM dashboard.

6. Click "Create Group."
