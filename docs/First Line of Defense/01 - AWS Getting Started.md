### **What is AWS? What is it all about?**

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a secure and comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. A **cloud platform** offers a range of services like computing power, storage, databases, and networking over the internet, allowing users to manage and scale resources without owning physical hardware. AWS embodies this concept by delivering a vast array of services on a "pay-as-you-go" basis, meaning you only pay for what you use. Known for its reliability, scalability, and flexibility, AWS supports a wide range of applications and use cases.

An AWS account is like a container where you keep all your AWS resources and manage them. It handles two main things: access control (who can use the resources) and billing (how much you are charged).
