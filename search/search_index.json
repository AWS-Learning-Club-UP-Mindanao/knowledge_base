At the time, Amazon realized that its e-commerce business required a significant amount of computing power, but these resources were often underutilized during non-peak periods. This led Amazon to explore ways to capitalize on excess computing capacity. The realization of their internal challenges and inefficiencies\u2014managing infrastructure that could scale up for peak seasons and then remain idle during downtime\u2014prompted the company to think of a broader solution. By the mid-2000s, the company recognized a gap in the market where other organizations were facing similar issues, and AWS was born to help businesses avoid the capital expense and complexity of managing their own IT infrastructure.  </p>"},{"location":"Workshops/Cloud%20Computing/Backbone%20of%20AWS/00%20-%20History%20of%20AWS%20-%20Its%20emergence/#the-emergence-of-cloud-based-services","title":"The Emergence of Cloud-Based Services","text":"<p>AWS represents a paradigm shift in how companies manage IT services. Rather than investing in physical servers or data centers, businesses could now rent computing resources on demand. AWS introduced this idea of a cloud-based service model that allowed companies to quickly scale up or down based on demand. This flexibility dramatically lowered the costs associated with IT infrastructure while allowing businesses to focus more on innovation rather than maintenance. The initial offerings, such as Simple Storage Service (S3) and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), gave businesses scalable storage and computing power with the added benefits of reliability, speed, and security.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Workshops/Cloud%20Computing/Backbone%20of%20AWS/00%20-%20History%20of%20AWS%20-%20Its%20emergence/#from-renting-servers-to-offering-a-comprehensive-ecosystem","title":"From Renting Servers to Offering a Comprehensive Ecosystem","text":"<p>AWS started primarily as a service to rent out excess server capacity through EC2. However, this was only the beginning of a more extensive ecosystem. Over time, AWS expanded from basic server renting to offering a wide array of services, including managed databases, machine learning, content delivery, networking, security, and developer tools. These services are now used by businesses globally to handle everything from basic web hosting to complex data analytics and artificial intelligence applications.

They aimed to create a platform that could help developers build applications more efficiently.</p> <p>2006: Official Launch of AWS   AWS officially launched in 2006 with its first services, Simple Storage Service (S3) and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). These services allowed businesses to rent storage and computing power on demand.</p> <p>2007-2011: Growth and New Services   AWS rapidly grew and expanded its services, including the introduction of Relational Database Service (RDS) in 2009, CloudFront for content delivery in 2008, and Elastic Block Store (EBS) in 2008.</p> <p>2012-2015: Global Expansion   AWS expanded its global infrastructure with new data centers worldwide, establishing a robust presence in regions like Europe, Asia, and South America. During this period, it launched over 100 new services, including DynamoDB (2012) and Redshift (2013).</p> <p>2016: $10 Billion Milestone    AWS hit $10 billion in annual revenue in 2016. This highlights its dominance in the cloud industry.

You cannot directly use an AMI from one region in another region without copying it over.</p> </li> <li> <p>Operating system   An AMI is specific to the operating system that is installed on the root volume of the instance. This includes both Linux distributions (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and Windows Server AMIs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Processor architecture   AMIs are tied to specific processor architectures, such as x86 (64-bit, Intel/AMD architecture) or ARM (64-bit, AWS Graviton architecture). Instances launched from an AMI must be compatible with the processor architecture of the underlying hardware.</p> </li> <li> <p>Root device type   AMIs are either EBS-backed or instance store-backed, and the type of root device affects how the instance stores and retains data.</p> </li> <li>EBS-backed AMI: The root device is an Amazon EBS volume, which allows for persistent storage, meaning data remains even if the instance is stopped.</li> <li> <p>Instance store-backed AMI: The root device is an instance store volume, which is ephemeral, meaning data is lost when the instance stops or terminates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Virtualization type   AMIs support two types of virtualization: HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) and PV (Paravirtual).</p> </li> <li>HVM: Instances launched from HVM AMIs are fully virtualized and take advantage of hardware-level features like enhanced networking, GPU access, and more. These instances are compatible with modern EC2 instance types.</li> <li>PV: PV instances use paravirtualization, which is an older virtualization method that has lower performance compared to HVM. PV instances do not have access to the same hardware-level features as HVM.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>AMIs are the foundation for launching EC2 instances, and they provide a quick and efficient way to launch instances with pre-configured software and settings.

This approach is especially useful for scenarios that require short-term access or adhere to best practices that discourage hardcoding credentials. Unlike IAM users, IAM roles provide temporary security credentials, which can be assumed by various entities such as users or applications.  IAM roles are versatile and can be used in several important ways. They allow AWS services, such as EC2 instances, to securely access other AWS resources like S3 buckets. Additionally, they facilitate cross-account access, enabling resources and permissions to be shared between different AWS accounts. IAM roles also support role chaining, where multiple roles can be assumed in sequence to achieve varying levels of access.
